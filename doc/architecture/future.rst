==================
Future Development
==================

Mini-PyAMF provides complete support for encoding and decoding AMF
versions 0 and 3.  What with the general deprecation of Flash on the
Web, I do not expect that there will be newer versions of AMF to
support.

Restoration of support for compatibility with various web frameworks
(Django, Twisted, etc.) would be welcome but I have no plans to do so
myself.
